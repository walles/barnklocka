# Icon
`icon.png` is done in [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) based
on `icon.xcf`.

`icon.xcf` is a composition of the following two images:
* <https://openclipart.org/detail/299275/simple-alarm-clock>
* <https://pixabay.com/en/pointer-pointing-index-finger-hand-152868/#>

The actual `mipmaps` launcher icons were created by right-clicking **res** and doing New / Image
Asset.

is done using the following font:
